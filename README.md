# WATER-LEVELLING-SYSTEM-USING-GSM-900-MODULE
A water leveling system with a GSM-900 module sends SMS alerts about water levels. Sensors in tanks monitor the levels and send automatic messages when they reach set points. This provides real-time updates, helping with timely refills or pump activation, ensuring efficient water use and preventing shortages or overflows.
